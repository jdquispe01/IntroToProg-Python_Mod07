##        Using Error Handling and Pickling data 

In this assignment, python error handling and pickling were discussed. As well as opening files options. In Topic 1, I added Python handling webpages that reiterated the information from the online class videos. Also, I included screenshots of code that I wrote and executed to show ‘try/except’ error handling and pickling module. 

###     Topic 1. Find Python Exception Handling webpages

[exception handling webpage1](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_exceptions.htm)
- The reason I liked this webpage is because it lists a lot of common exceptions used. Instead of listing all of them which can be overwhelming to look at or search. It also lists examples and explanations.

[youtube video of exception handling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIWwJbo-9_8)
- This web video is helpful, because it is small ~10min and explains the exception. 


###     Topic 1. Find pickling webpages

- This video is short and goes into the very basics of pickling files.

[Tutorial webpage of pickling examples](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python-pickling)
-	I like this webpage, because it has examples of pickling and how to use the pickling module. 


### Topic 3. 
Python code to make binary file: 
```python
import pickle

sample_file_dict= {'Id':"John",'floor':"first floor", 'room':"B1"} #sample information in dictionary data
pickled_file = open("sample_dict_file.dat", 'wb') # This makes a new .dat file , binary file
pickle.dump(sample_file_dict,pickled_file) # The dump command writes all the data to the 'sample_dict_file.dat file that was opened
pickled_file.close() # The file is closed
```

### Topic 4
Python code to make exception:
```python
import pickle

sample_file_dict= {'Id':"John",'floor':"first floor", 'room':"B1"} #sample information in dictionary data
pickled_file = open("sample_dict_file.dat", 'wb') # This makes a new .dat file , binary file
pickle.dump(sample_file_dict,pickled_file) # The dump command writes all the data to the 'sample_dict_file.dat file that was opened
pickled_file.close() # The file is closed

'''To convert the binary file back to a dictionary data and print'''
pickled_file = open("sample_dict_file.dat", "rb") # This will load up the binary file
unpickled_file = pickle.load(pickled_file) # This converts the binary to a dictionary data
print (unpickled_file) # This prints the 'unpickled' data from


# Example of Exception error handling
# This will use the exception of wrong file used to open file
# File used is the one from pickle example, sample_file_dict.txt
try:
    file_name=str(input("enter name of file: ")) #This requests the file name
    Dic_File= open(file_name,"r") #This will open file
    for row in Dic_File: # reads out each row
        print (row) # print the correct file in binary format.
except FileNotFoundError as e:      #I used the specific exception of file not found
    print(file_name + "\tfile not correct")     #prints the value entered and description of error
    
```
